            <h3>What is a Blockchain?</h3>

            <p> A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is shaking up the financial industry, much the same way webpages shook up traditional brick-and-mortar businesses. 
                Technology in general is rapidly advancing, with companies starting to deliver products by drones less than 30 minutes after you place an online order.  We want everything
                now, and do not like to wait.  Unfortuantely, the financial industry is burdened with lots of regulation that causes adoption of new technologies to be slow and sometimes painful.
                Although I will receive the items I order the same day, the full financial transaction may take anywhere from 1-3 days to be finalized.  This is just for a basic transaction, and only gets
                worse the more complex a transaction is (think stocks, options, etc.) .
            </p>
